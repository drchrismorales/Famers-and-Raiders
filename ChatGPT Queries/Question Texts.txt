#1
# The "Random" strategy
# This agent randomly chooses between ATTACK and FARM with equal probability.

#2
# The "Pavlovian" strategy (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift)
# Cooperates if it and its opponent moved alike in previous move and defects if they moved differently.

#3
# Reactive (with parameters y,p,q)
# Cooperates with probability y in first round and with probabilities p or q after opponent cooperates or defects.

#4
#Random TitTat
# On the first turn, it randomly chooses to farm or attack, then does whatever the other agent did last time.

#4b
#Random TitTat
# When first meeting a new agent, it randomly chooses to farm or attack, then does whatever the other agent did last time.

#5
# The "Grudger" strategy
# Initially cooperates but if the other agent has ever attacked, this agent will always ATTACK in response.

#6
#The "Exploiter" strategy
# It starts by cooperating, then
# 1. If the other agent has never attacked, it attacks.
# 2. If the other agent also attacks on its first move, it keeps attacking.
# 3. If the other agent farmed on its first move, it attacks until the other agent attacks. Then:
# 3a. It farms twice.
# 3b. From then on it copies the other agent's last move.

#7
#Once-burned, twice-shy strategy
# On the first move, if the most recent move of the most recently-added key in the memory is an attack, it will attack. On subsequent moves copy the other agent's last move.
